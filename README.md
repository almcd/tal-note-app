# TAL Notes App

An app no one wants or needs - a note taking app for your TV! Originally built in Spring 2016 using the [BBC TAL framework](http://bbc.github.io/tal/) for TV app development, to better familiarise myself with BBC TAL. Based on the [BBC TAL example app](https://github.com/bbc/talexample).

## Getting started
- Clone the repo
- `cd` into `tal-note-app`
- Start a local PHP server: `php -S localhost:8000`
